Google provides a nifty method to track events in your web application. They are referring to this
API as the **Measurement Protocol**. The big advantage with this low-level protocol compared to
the traditional web tracking with `analytics.js` is, that you have to power of full control what is
going to be tracked and when.

The whole API is using one of following endpoints:

	http://www.google-analytics.com/collect		// for http
	https://ssl.google-analytics.com/collect	// for ssl

You have to make a GET or preferential a POST request to one of the endpoints. Only use GET when
you have not technical opportunity to do it with a POST.

There is a number of available parameters accepted by the API. At the end of this post youÂ´ll find
a link to the parameter reference. Following example shows a POST-Request with the typical parameters
required for Event-Tracking:

```js
var trackingId = "UA-XXXXXXXX-X";
var clientId = "35009a79-1a05-49d7-b876-2b884d0f825b";

var trackEvent = function(category, action, label) {
	$.post('https://ssl.google-analytics.com/collect', {
		"t": 	"event",
		"ec": 	category,
		"ea": 	action,
		"el": 	label,
		"v": 	"1",
		"tid": 	trackingId,
		"cid": 	clientId
	});
};
```

So what is what?

- `t`: hit type - We chose `event`, this makes the additional parameters *ec* and *ea* mandatory:
- `ec`: event category - User defined string
- `ea`: event action - User defined string
- `el`: event label - User defined string, optional
- `v`: protocol version, currently only "1" is supported
- `tid`: tracking id in format UA-XXXX-Y
- `cid`: client id - Used to identify the client within multiple tracks. Should be a valid UUID format (e.g. 35009a79-1a05-49d7-b876-2b884d0f825b)


To track any event, just call the method with your category, action and label:

```js
trackEvent('homeScreen', 'userSelectsFilter', 'Active Items')
```

The response returns a small tracking gif image with the size of 1x1 px. When you create the tracking
 request in the way described above, you can simply ignore the response.
