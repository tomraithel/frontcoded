IÂ´m **Tom Raithel**. This is my blog about various frontend web development topics.
I mainly write this blog as a reference for myself but if you find something useful for you - even better!

The blog ist based on [Mediator](https://github.com/dirkfabisch/mediator), a Jekyll theme from Dirk Fabisch.
